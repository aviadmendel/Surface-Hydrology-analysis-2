    "After reviewing in our last project the precipitation part which is what we \"receive\" from the sky, we will now check what we \"bring back\" by calculating the evapotranspiration (we will use the shortcut - Et). Of course it is all a big cycle and all connected so maybe it would be good to check two same locations and using the two data of precipitation and evaporation to see if we find a correlation between the two but in this project we will focus only in the Et.\n",

Also, as we know Florida is quite a hot place so generally speaking I expect higher temperatures throughout the year in comparison to Yosemite and also less cloudy sky which will affect the radiation.

    "Generally speaking looking on both graphs of Thornthwaite Et and the temperature we can easily see the coraltion between the two. when the temperature on both locations goes up the Et goes up as well.  the affect of I and alpha is different in both equation since it consider the sum of the monthly mean with more variables (I equation) and thats affect on the third equation as well(alpha).\n",
    "With that said we can see the changes with the temperature along the year affect differently on each location.\n",
    "Also, we can see that in the lower sector of temperature (about 10 degrees and less) a big difference between the two locations affect less about the difference in it while in the higher temperature even a small difference affect quite a lot. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can look at the first checkpoint in the graph while the temperature in Yosemite is around -3 degrees and in Everglades around 17 degrees the difference in Et is around 25 mm per month and in the highest checkpoint in Yosemite is 20 degrees and in Everglades is 27 degrees we receive a difference of around 40 mm per month. \n",
    "Which means a 20 degrees difference in the lower sector of temperature leads us to a 25 mm per month of Et while only 7 degrees difference in the higher sector of temperatures leads us to 40 mm per month of Et.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, after saying that the temperature affects directly on the temperature we can look back and remember that we expected this kind of behavior along the year in both places. \n",
    "As we said in the introduction, we expected higher temperature in Everglades throughout the year than in Yosemite and also we expected Yosemite to have cold winter with low temperature and then hotter summer. I'm happy to say that I was right this time!"

On the other hand a four mm per day difference we see in Yosemite during the summer can worry us a bit, looking at Thorthwaite equation assuming the Penman equation include more data and it is more accurate.\n",

    "### RH and VPD\n",
    "The two graphs on the left shows the relative humidity and VPD (Vapour pressure deficit) tells us two things, first of all, the fact that in general as we expected the RH near the ocean in Everglades is higher than Yosemite and constant all year long and very high around 75% and higher (sounds sweaty) while in Yosemite the maximum is around 65% and during the summer goes down to 35%.\n",
    "It is quite straight forward from the equations, but even easier to see in the two graphs the opposite influence of the two - high RH means lower VPD.\n",
    "Looking at the equations Et is higher when> Ea is higher > VPD is higher > ed is lower> RH is lower. It is all a big chain that affected by few parameters and a big component of them is RH. That's a first good explanation of why during the summer when the RH in Yosemite is lower the Et is higher while the RH in Everglades is very high and the Et is lower.\n",
    "Not getting into all details the simple explanation that we can understand is that high VPD means that the air is quite dry and \"demand\" more water from the ground and plants to balance it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temperature\n",
    "moving on to the temperature graph now when looking again at the full equations we might start getting a clue for why the temperature has such a big impact on our result. Lambda, es (and ed from es) and delta are calculated directly from T and we also noticed it while writing the functions in the code. That is the reason Thornthwaite work quite well and also when looking at Penmans results there is a quite good correlation with the temperature graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wind speed\n",
    "In our last graph we see the data for wind speed at 1.5 m above ground. We can see as we assume at the beginning that Yosemite is more windy then  Everglades because it is 1200 above sea level and there are lots of mountains around. In Everglades we can see a couple of very windy places and assuming that it is not a measurement mistake we expected some stormy weather every once in a while. Maybe once in a year is enough, but I expected a bit more occasions with stormy weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see in the equations that the higher value of wind speed will make Ea go higher and eventually raising Et. That again a reason why during summer the Et in Yosemite is higher while during winter when wind speed differences between the two places is lower and also we assume that the low temperature during winter in Yosemite affect more and lower Et significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that the affect of wind is \"clearly\" the air around the boundary layer in a way that there is constant movement and the boundary layer \"see\" dry air all the time after evaporating water into the air (same for the ground).\n"

    "# Summary\n",
    "To summerize this project we wanted to check the estimated Et with two methods - one Thornthwaite equation and the second Penman equation - and compared them in two locations - Yosemite and Everglades. We made few assumptions and we found most of them fit with our results. We didn't have acttual Et results to say which one of the methods is better, but we assumed that Penmans equation that include more data and is a theory based is better than Thorthwaite which is empirical.\n",
    "With that said we saw pretty good correlation between two methods in Everglades, but in Yosemite the result showed too big of a difference during the summer. We offered that if needed to use Thornthwaite equation and have on hand only the temperature data it will be good to fit the constants with more empirical tests to different climates.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare between the two locations and the differences they have that affect the Et we tried to look closer on the data that we use in the equations and finally use in the full Penman equation and focused on temperature, RH, VPD and wind speed. We managed to notice looking at the temperature graph and its major role in Penmans equation why Thornthwaite thought it can be a good idea using temperature only to find Et.\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe we managed to find the difference, especially in summer after looking at the VPD, RH and wind speed graph. All three affect on higher Et and in all three graphs (VPD and RH are quite correlated as we said earlier) Yosemite shows higher values which probably is a big part of the higher Et during summer in Yosemite compare to Everglades "
